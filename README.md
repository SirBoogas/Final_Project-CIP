This is my final project for code in place.
its a small version of a fantasy text battles.
The goal is to pick the best options to win the battles against the enemys, 
You have 5 rounds to beat, going from easiest enemy to hardest.
After each round you can select an upgrade of your choice.
Finally after beating all 5 enemys you will fight the FINAL BOSS!
It is supposed to be semi hard but i also made it possible to be beaten by less skilled!
Goodluck and thank you for checking it out!
